# Tiny Economy EVM

A tiny script for spinning up a tiny local economy.

Written for small personal ethereum-platform experiments between groups who can trust a single validator running ganache (a test blockchain client).

To install (with node.js installed): `npm install ganache-cli -g`.

To run: `./start.sh`.
